## Using Prettier on the project


### What is Prettier?

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter tool. It's pretty handy when it comes to
collaboration between developers.

### How to use Prettier with WebStorm on Mac

* Install Prettier with npm
* Webstorm Settings ‚Üí Languages & Frameworks ‚Üí JavaScript ‚Üí
  1. Enable Prettier
  2. Enable _On 'Reformat Code' action_
  3. Enable _On save_

### Debugging Prettier with WebStorm on Mac

If, for some reason, Prettier doesn't work automatically on save, open the project in the Terminal and
try debugging Prettier with `prettier . --write`.

In my case, enabling the On save feature didn't work at all,
so I had to do this additional step:

Webstorm Settings ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Actions on save ‚Üí Tick _Reformat Code_

This should fix the problem of Prettier not running on save.
